            <p><b>Welcome to CrAlSim</b></p>
            <p>This website is dedicated to explaining clearly how a variety of codes and ciphers work, how to use them to both encrypt and decrypt a message, and simulating various ciphers to show the internal stepwise working of algorithm. <br>
              This site is a place where user gets to learn the working principle of cryptography and can visualise behind the scenes working of algorithms. <br>
              For each cipher, there is a detailed description of how the cipher works <br>
              Along the top of the page you have the navigation bars, which you can use at any point to access information on any given code. It is recommended that you start at the beginning, and work your way through the list, since they get harder and more complicated as we progress through them. <br>
              So basically
